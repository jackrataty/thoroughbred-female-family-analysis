    <h2>Speed Isn't the Same as Value</h2>

    <p>
      Earlier, I focused on which female families produced an unusually large share of fast horses.
      That answers a narrow question: <em>who can flash ability?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      But there's a second question that matters just as much to owners and buyers:
      <strong>who converts speed into money?</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="insight">
      <p>
        <strong>Key idea:</strong> Many horses can hit a 90+ speed figure at least once.
        Fewer stay sound and consistent enough to turn that ability into earnings.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>How I Measured "Converting Speed into Money"</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flash-capable group:</strong> horses that reached <strong>SF ≥ 90</strong> at least once</li>
      <li><strong>Economic outcome:</strong> <strong>total lifetime earnings</strong></li>
      <li>
        Within the SF ≥ 90 group, horses are split into earnings quartiles:
        <strong>bottom 25%</strong> ("flash but broke"), <strong>middle 50%</strong>, <strong>top 25%</strong> ("flash that paid")
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="stats-grid">
      <div class="stat-card">
        <span class="number">3,020</span>
        <span class="label">Horses with SF ≥ 90</span>
      </div>
      <div class="stat-card">
        <span class="number">25%</span>
        <span class="label">Baseline "top earner" rate</span>
      </div>
      <div class="stat-card">
        <span class="number">25%</span>
        <span class="label">Flash-but-broke rate</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is the uncomfortable truth:
      <strong>one out of every four horses that proved real ability (SF ≥ 90) failed economically</strong>.
      I'm not claiming I can see "injury" in the data — but earnings require starts, soundness, and survivability.
      Low earnings paired with real speed is the footprint of attrition.
    </p>

    <h3>Families That Convert Speed Into Money</h3>
    <p>
      Below are families that produced fast horses <em>and</em> converted a higher-than-baseline share into top-quartile earners.
      Baseline is <strong>25%</strong>. Anything meaningfully above that suggests speed that holds together long enough to pay.

        <strong>Interpretation:</strong> These families don't just throw speed — they throw speed that survives.
        This is where "peak ability" stops being a sales talking-point and starts being economically meaningful.

    <h3>Families That Leak Value</h3>
    <p>
      These families produced fast horses, but a far smaller share became top-quartile earners.
      In plain terms: <strong>speed showed up, but the money didn't</strong>.

    <h3>The 9-h Twist: More Speed, Less Money</h3>
    <p>
      This is where the analysis becomes useful.
      In the earlier speed-only screen, <strong>9-h looked attractive</strong> because it produced more fast horses than expected.
      But when we add earnings, 9-h tells a different story:
    </p>

    <div class="insight">
      <p>
        <strong>9-h produced speed — but it did not convert speed into money.</strong>
        In this crop, it behaves like a "flashy but fragile" family.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      That doesn't contradict the earlier conclusion — it refines it.
      A family can be good at producing peak performance and still be weak at producing durable, economically productive runners.
    </p>

    <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>
      If your goal is to buy or breed for real-world value, the question isn't only "who can run fast once?"
      It's "who produces speed that <em>holds together</em> long enough to pay?"
      This is exactly the distinction that raw speed-only pages miss.
